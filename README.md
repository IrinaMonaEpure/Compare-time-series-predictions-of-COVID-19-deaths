# Compare time series predictions of COVID 19 deaths

I preprocessed data describing time-dependent trends of COVID 19 casualties and applied SARIMAX, Prophet, XGBOOST, and a neural network to model the data. I compared the accuracies obtained with each method.

I completed this project as part of a Coursera module created by Sherif A. Tawfik Abbas. The module is available here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/compare-time-series-predictions-of-covid19-deaths/home/welcome
